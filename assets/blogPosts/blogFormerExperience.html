                <h1>BLOG: Former programming experience</h1>
                <h3>A short story about my only prior programming experience</h3>
                <p id="blogExperiencefit">
                    When thinking of former programming experience, the only thing that comes to
                    mind for me was the website I 'made' during my ICT classes in seconday school. One day we were given
                    the task to create a website to track the nearby weather, which we were supposed to do by using
                    local meters. The normal secondary school ICT lecture consisted of 2 hours of me and my friends
                    doing absolutely anything on the computers other than school work, which didn't change for this
                    project. Until the final moment, The couple weeks we had to complete our websites were spent on
                    making and filling in pointless forms with eachother and playing random games. As we were now
                    rapidly running out of time, we finally decided to get to work, though it didn't take long for us to
                    give up. We had done 0 practice and listened to barely anything our teacher had said over the weeks
                    and didn't understand what we were doing. Eventually, we figured out we could just steal templates
                    off the internet, change some things here and there and call it our own. At the end of it all, we
                    had completely unfunctional websites, but at least they looked nice. We ended up still getting
                    decent grades too so... moral of the story: work smarter not harder I guess
